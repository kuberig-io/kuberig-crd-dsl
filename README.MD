# KubeRig CRD DSL

This repository contains KubeRig DSL generator projects for Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions. 

Please note: this repo is in early stage development and will change a lot. At this point the DSLs are not yet published to JCenter.

It can serve as a starting point for finding ready to go KubeRig DSL dependencies. 
It can also show you how to generate a KubeRig DSL when the CRDs you want to consume have not been added yet.
